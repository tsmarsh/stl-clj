# stl-clj

A Clojure library designed aid the manipulation of STL files.

Ultimate aim is to make it trivial to collect and flatten multiple
stls into a single stl file.

Current status:

* Read binary stl
* Write binary stl
* Linear translation of stls
* Combination of multiple stl into a single file

Planning on creating an app that simplifies the process using this
library.

## Usage

The primary use case for this library is taking a directory of Binary STL files and turning them into a single STL file to reduce the need for baby sitting.

The machine is just the printable area defined as a width, depth, height in millimeters: [w d h]

The buffer is added as a border to each file to prevent them touching, values between 1.0 and 5.0 have worked well for me.

Output is the absolute path to the destination file.

Dir is directory containing the stl files.


```
(combine [75.0 75.0 75.0] 0.0 "/path/to/output.stl" "/path/to/input/stl")
```

It is possible that more convienience functions like this will emerge
as more real world use happens.

Whilst it is trivial to use this now if you are a clojure developer, the primary function of this library is to back an application with a more humane interface.
