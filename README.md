# stl-clj

A Clojure library designed aid the manipulation of STL files.

Ultimate aim is to make it trivial to collect and flatten multiple
stls into a single stl file.

Current status:

* Read binary stl
* Write binary stl
* Linear translation of stls
* Combination of multiple stl into a single file

Planning on creating an app that simplifies the process using this
library.

## Usage

This code takes filenames as input, reads in the stl files,
distributes them across the x axis with a 10 gap, then combines them
into a single file.

```
(defn combine-files [output & filenames]
  (let [stls (map r/read-stl filenames)
        faces (map t/facify stls)
        distributed-faces (t/distribute-x faces 10)
        recombined-faces (t/combine distributed-faces)
        normalized-faces (t/normalize recombined-faces)]
    (w/write-stl normalized-faces output)))
```

It is possible that more convienience functions like this will emerge
as more real world use happens.
